In the animal-community studies field, it has been discussed for a while how node-labels permutation does not actually perform as well as initially though given that most permutations do not satisfy the joint probabilities smth smth dont remember exactly [FIX] \cite{nullmodel2017}; fairly recently, a theoretical proof that node-label permutation perform exactly like non-network-based parametric methods has been published [ADD REFERENCE]. That being said, the network approach INSERT REASON WHY THE NETWORK APPROACH IS STILL GOOD, LIKE INTERPRETABILITY AND SUCH.
