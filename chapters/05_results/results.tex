\chapter{Results}

% The Results part describes all the experiments performed and their statistical analysis (at least 10, maximum 40 pages). If you want to provide replication data, include them in another appendix (Appendix II).

\section{Pixel preprocessing}

\subsection{Pixel filtering}
% Pixel filtering statistics

\subsection{Pixel deduplication and sorting}
% Ideally I would like to skip this since it SHOULD NOT BE NEEDED

\subsection{Pixel distance normalization}
% Comparison with cooltools normalization

\subsection{Pixel sparsification score computation}
% For sure memory and time benchmarking

% Actually test different thresholds and see differences
% Place optimal alpha computation here (the curve plot)
% Jaccard index is here or prior

% SKIP ANNOTATION SECTION RIGHT? OR SOME STATISTICS

\section{Network generation and analysis}

\subsection{Node-labels permutation}
% Permutation plot with no pattern

\subsection{Contrast subgraphs}
% If it will be done 

% Other analysis Leo made
