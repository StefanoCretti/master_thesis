\chapter{Results}

% The Results part describes all the experiments performed and their statistical analysis (at least 10, maximum 40 pages). If you want to provide replication data, include them in another appendix (Appendix II).

\section{Pixel preprocessing}

\subsection{Pixel filtering}
% Pixel filtering statistics

\subsection{Pixel distance normalization}
% Comparison with cooltools normalization

\subsection{Pixel sparsification score computation}
% For sure memory and time benchmarking

% Actually test different thresholds and see differences
% Place optimal alpha computation here (the curve plot)
% Jaccard index is here or prior

% SKIP ANNOTATION SECTION RIGHT? OR SOME STATISTICS

\section{Network generation and analysis}

\subsection{Node-labels permutation}
% Permutation plot with no pattern


% TODO: Use the following statement when defining the chunks
% It follows that the reported file size is then 20 bytes times the number of rows of the pixel table.
% Since two columns of the pixel table ("bin1\_id" and "bin2\_id") are vectors of 64-bit signed integers, while the remaining one ("count") is a vector of 32-bit signed integers, each row of the pixel table requires 20 bytes of memory.
